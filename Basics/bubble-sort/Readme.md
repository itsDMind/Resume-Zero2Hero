# Bubble Sort README

## Overview

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Usage

### Implementation

Bubble Sort can be implemented in various programming languages.

### Complexity

Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, where 'n' is the number of elements in the array. It is not the most efficient algorithm for large datasets, but it is simple to understand and implement.


## Acknowledgments

Bubble Sort is a fundamental sorting algorithm and serves as a starting point for understanding more complex sorting techniques.
