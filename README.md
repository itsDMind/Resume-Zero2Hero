This repository is in answer to who ask "What languages do you code?" and "What skills and abilities do you have?"

In this code repository, I am going to develop sample code for routine questions, ranging from easy to challenging. I've utilized various programming languages that I'm proficient in, as well as languages and questions within my knowledge base.
