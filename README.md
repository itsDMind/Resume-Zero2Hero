This repository is in answer to who ask "What languages do you code?" and "What skills and abilities do you have?"

In this code repository, I am going to develop sample code for routine questions, ranging from easy to challenging. I've utilized various programming languages that I'm proficient in, as well as languages and questions within my knowledge base.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Rust
- Go
- javascript

## ðŸ›  Challenges (Basics)
I implement all of these issues with all the programming stack that I know:

### Problem 1: Fibonacci Sequence

  - Implement a function to generate the nth Fibonacci number.

### Problem 2: Factorial

  - Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

### Problem 3: Palindrome Check

  - Create a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.

### Problem 4: Prime Numbers

  - Write a program to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit.

### Problem 5: Bubble Sort

  - Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.

### Problem 6: Binary Search

  - Write a function to perform binary search on a sorted list.

### Problem 7: Linked List

  - Create a simple linked list and implement basic operations like insertion and deletion.

### Problem 8: Stack Implementation

  - Implement a stack with push and pop operations.

### Problem 9: Queue Implementation

  - Create a queue with enqueue and dequeue operations.

### Problem 10: Recursion

  - Solve a problem using recursion, such as computing the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.

### Problem 11: Hash Map Implementation

  - Implement a basic hash map with functions to insert and retrieve key-value pairs.

### Problem 12: Graph Representation

  - Create a representation of a graph and implement depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

### Problem 13: Dijkstra's Algorithm

  - Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.

### Problem 14: Mergesort

  - Write a function to perform the merge sort algorithm on a list.

### Problem 15: QuickSort

  - Implement the quicksort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.

### Problem 16: Tree Traversal

  - Create a binary tree and implement in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.

### Problem 17: Dynamic Programming: Knapsack Problem

  - Solve the 0/1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming.

### Problem 18: Trie Implementation

  - Implement a trie data structure.

### Problem 19: Depth-First Search (DFS) on a Graph

  - Perform depth-first search on a graph and print the traversal order.

### Problem 20: Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a Graph

  - Perform breadth-first search on a graph and print the traversal order.
